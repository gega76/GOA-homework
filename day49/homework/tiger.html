            <p style="background-color: black; font-size: 45px; color: green;">The tiger is important to us because it plays a key role in keeping nature balanced and healthy. As a top predator, the tiger controls the population of herbivores like deer and wild boar, which prevents overgrazing and helps forests and grasslands grow properly. When these ecosystems stay healthy, they support many other plants and animals and also provide clean air, water, and resources that humans depend on. Tigers are also an indicator species, meaning that when tigers are doing well, the whole ecosystem is usually healthy too. In addition, tigers have great cultural and educational value, symbolizing strength and protection in many cultures, and they inspire people to care more about wildlife conservation. Protecting tigers also means protecting large natural areas, which benefits both biodiversity and future generations of people.</p>
