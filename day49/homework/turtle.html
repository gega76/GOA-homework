            <p style="background-color: black; font-size: 45px; color: green;">The turtle is important to us because it helps keep ecosystems healthy both on land and in the water. Sea turtles maintain the balance of ocean life by controlling jellyfish populations and helping seagrass beds stay healthy, which provides food and shelter for many marine species and stores carbon that helps fight climate change. Land and freshwater turtles help clean their environments by eating dead plants and animals, reducing the spread of disease. Turtles also play a role in nutrient cycling, as they move nutrients between water and land. In addition, turtles have cultural, scientific, and educational value, teaching us about longevity, adaptation, and the importance of protecting nature. By protecting turtles, we protect entire ecosystems that humans depend on for food, clean water, and a healthy planet.</p>
