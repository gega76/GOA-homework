                    <h1>Why are animals important?</h1>
                    <p>Animals are important because they help keep the natural world balanced and healthy. They are part of ecosystems where each species has a role, such as controlling other animal populations, spreading seeds, and pollinating plants, which helps plants grow and produce oxygen. Animals also support human life by providing food like milk, eggs, and meat, as well as materials such as wool and leather. Many animals help people in daily life, for example by assisting farmers or guiding people with disabilities. They also help clean the environment by improving soil and reducing pests. In addition, animals bring joy and companionship to humans and teach responsibility and kindness. Scientists also study animals to learn more about nature and develop medicines. Overall, animals are essential for the environment, for human survival, and for the wellbeing of the planet.</p>
