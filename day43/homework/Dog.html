                    <h1>Why is Dog important?</h1>
                    <p>Dogs are important because they help humans in many ways and have been loyal companions for thousands of years. They provide emotional support, reduce stress, and make people feel less lonely by offering unconditional love and friendship. Dogs also play vital roles in society by working as guide dogs for the visually impaired, therapy dogs for people with mental or physical challenges, and police or rescue dogs that help find missing persons and protect communities. In addition, dogs can guard homes, help farmers manage livestock, and encourage people to stay active through walking and play. Their intelligence, loyalty, and strong bond with humans make them valuable not only as pets but also as helpers who improve safety, health, and overall quality of life.</p>
