                    <h1>Why is horse important?</h1>
                    <p>Horses are important because they have played a major role in human history and continue to help people today in many ways. For centuries, horses were used for transportation, farming, and carrying heavy loads, which helped societies grow and develop. They are still used in agriculture, sports, and recreation such as horseback riding and racing. Horses also provide emotional and therapeutic benefits, especially for people with physical or mental challenges, through equine therapy programs that build confidence and reduce stress. In addition, they are intelligent, strong, and social animals that form deep bonds with humans, teaching responsibility, patience, and respect for nature. Overall, horses contribute to culture, work, healing, and human connection, making them valuable and important animals in many parts of the world.</p>
