                    <h1>Why is Pig important?</h1>
                    <p>Pigs are important animals because they play a big role in food production and agriculture around the world. They provide a major source of meat that supplies people with protein and essential nutrients. Pigs are also very intelligent and adaptable, which makes them easier to raise and manage on farms. In rural areas, pig farming helps support families by providing income and improving local economies. Additionally, pigs help the environment by naturally turning over soil, which can improve soil quality. Their usefulness in farming, combined with their intelligence and contribution to food systems, makes pigs valuable animals for humans and society.</p>
